Gender War is a satirical narrative game that explores how online gender ideologies turn intimacy into conflict. By placing players inside exaggerated but familiar dating encounters shaped by incel and femcel subcultures, the game exposes how grievance, status logic, and algorithm driven discourse flatten human connection. Using humor and discomfort rather than moralizing, Gender War invites players to reflect on how digital culture scripts desire, worth, and power, and why stepping outside those scripts might be necessary for healthier gender relations.

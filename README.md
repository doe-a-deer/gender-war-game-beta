# gender-war-game-beta

Gender War is a satirical narrative game about how online gender ideologies turn dating into conflict. Set inside exaggerated but familiar encounters shaped by incel and femcel subcultures, the game explores how grievance, status logic, and algorithm driven discourse flatten intimacy and distort human connection.
## Developer Statement
Gender War was created as a critique, not a celebration, of the ways modern dating culture has been distorted by online discourse, identity performance, and adversarial thinking. The characters are intentionally exaggerated archetypes drawn from real internet subcultures, designed to feel uncomfortably familiar rather than realistic or flattering.

This project is not about assigning blame or offering clean moral resolutions. Instead, it uses satire, absurdity, and player choice to surface how quickly intimacy becomes transactional, defensive, or hostile when people relate to each other through ideology instead of empathy. If the game feels awkward, frustrating, or exposes habits you recognize, that discomfort is part of the experience.

## Things-to-do
- Fix sprites so they are consistent in size and framing  
- Crop and clean backgrounds on all character sprites  
- Link the game publicly for playtesting and feedback
